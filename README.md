# Python API for XFLR5 automation

Requires:

- XFLR5                 http://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm

- ahk python library    https://pypi.org/project/ahk/


## Explanation:

XFLR is  a great tool for low reynolds number analysis of UAVs but iterating through designs is a long process. PyXFLR automates the design iteration process, allowing easy analysis of infinite design possibilities and capturing the results to find the most optimal solution

## state of the project:

Currently having difficulty reliably controlling XFLR through python. 

## Features:

- [ ] Create foils
- [ ] Analyse foils
- [ ] Create plane configurations
- [ ] Create analysis methods
- [ ] Analyse plane configurations and save results to file
